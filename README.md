# Boring_Landing_Page_But_With_Curves
My 3rd HTML/CSS project : A responsive landing page with several layouts and curves, using a FrontendMentor.io design

(There are still some stuff to improve : size-scaling buttons and footer responsivity)

# What I learned

- "Mobile first" strategy is nice (and its pleasant to just have this thin mobile page on the right side of my screen, having VSCode on the whole left space of the left)

- I should have started the styles after having done the whole html content : I built the page section by section (header, then sections then footer) and realized afterward that there was a lot of common CSS properties between most of the elements. I tried to group some element styles, especially paragraphs, titles and buttons, but there is still a lot of things a can factorise. I think there are some tools to remove the useless CSS code, I'll try to use them in my next projects.

- Media queries can often be avoided : Thanks to some CSS-Youtube-guys, I discovered several ways to make my page responsive without using any media queries : adapting font size with clamp(), never using raw positions and sizes (using min/max-width and auto margin instead), using flex-wrap, etc... I love this way of doing things and will try to improve on that point

- I should lighten the HTML using ::before and ::after more often, especially for stuff like svg images

# Conclusion and some other stuff I learned
This is going to be my last HTML/CSS-only project for several reasons :

- I feel like it will require a long time so I become skilled in CSS, I'll practice a bit of it during all of my next projects, and try to learn tips from web developers I'll meet later, and look at some clean code examples

- I'm super bad at designing stuff by myself : I thought I could because I like drawing and painting but every initiative I take looks horrible. There is a paying FrontedMentor option to get Figma designs, I might try it once. Anyway, I am impatient to work with a UX/UI designed for real

- I'm too impatient starting learning JavaScript - As far as I've heard atm, it is not that much different to C and C++, and implements some equivalents of the cool stuff I liked in C++ : algorithm functions, OPP, etc

# More irrelevant stuff that looks like a teenage journal
- Most of my friends from 42 School recently finished the Minishell-hell project, they can start living again and discover the much more interesting stuff waiting for them, especially C++, and that fills me with happiness

- I have been intensively going to the school during almost 40 days in a roll, it's scary how quickly time runs out, but I liked that time, summer might has something to do with it

- I forgot father's day but I'm visiting my parents this weekend, I'll grab some super cool craft beers for my father to repair this
